The mutation, for its part, needs an argument to be fixed (the independent probability of each attribute to be mutated `indpb`). In the algorithms the `mutate()` function is called with the signature `toolbox.mutate(mutant)`. This is the most convenient way because each mutation takes a different number of arguments, having those arguments fixed in the toolbox leave open most of the possibilities to change the mutation (crossover, selection, or evaluation) operator later in your researches.
