==Guide to Using PACE-ICE==

==About PACE-ICE==
PACE is a computing infrastructure that allows us to standardize our runs of EMADE and to run them on a more powerful/configurable machine than we may have locally.

==How to get started with PACE-ICE==
This has all been tested on PACE-ICE, but similar processes should exist for other servers. Make sure you can ssh onto the server with <blockquote>ssh USERNAME@pace-ice.pace.gatech.edu</blockquote>the username is your Georgia Tech username and the password is your Georgia Tech password.

If you're not on Georgia Tech wifi make sure you're using the VPN.

* Use sftp or scp to move your local emade directory to your pace directory
** Once emade is on pace, you can delete the datasets you don’t need and .git/ directory from the pace version
* Install the packages you need, I made a conda environment called ‘emade2’
* Specifying the charset can fix some mysql version compatibility issues:
** Add "?charset=utf8" to the database strings in “launchEMADE.py”, and “sql_connection_orm_base.py” and seeding if needed
* Remove all references to innodb_lock_wait_timeout since that wasn't supported on pace's version of mysql
Follow instructions at <nowiki>https://docs.pace.gatech.edu/software/mysql/</nowiki> to get mysql set up

For your .my.cnf use:

'''[mysqld]'''

'''datadir=/nv/pace-ice/USERNAME/scratch/db'''

'''socket=/nv/pace-ice/USERNAME/scratch/db/mysqldb.sock'''

'''user=USERNAME'''

'''symbolic-links=0'''

'''innodb_lock_wait_timeout=1000'''

'''[mysqld_safe]'''

'''log-error=/nv/pace-ice/USERNAME/scratch/db/mysqldb.log'''

'''pid-file=/nv/pace-ice/USERNAME/scratch/db/mysqldb.pid'''

'''[mysql]'''

'''socket=/nv/pace-ice/USERNAME/scratch/db/mysqldb.sock'''
* Create PBS scripts to run mysql and emade

=== pbsmysql.pbs: ===
* Basically the same as provided on pace's documentation but with the added innodb_lock_wait_timeout
* We set it manually whereas before emade set it at runtime
'''#!/bin/bash'''

'''#PBS -N mysqldb'''

'''#PBS -q pace-ice'''

'''#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1'''

'''#PBS -l walltime=10:00:00'''

'''#PBS -M USERNAME@gatech.edu'''

'''mysqld_safe --innodb_lock_wait_timeout=1000'''

=== '''runEmade.pbs''' ===
* cd's into emade's directory, loads the conda environment, and starts emade with your xml file
'''#PBS -N emade-nlp-app'''

'''#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=18'''

'''#PBS -l pmem= 7gb'''

'''#PBS -l walltime=10:00:00'''

'''#PBS -q pace-ice'''

'''#PBS -j oe'''

'''#PBS -o emadeNLP-App.out'''

'''#PBS -m abe'''

'''#PBS -M USERNAME@gatech.edu'''

'''cd EMADE_DIRECTORY'''

'''echo "Started on `/bin/hostname`"               # prints the name of the node job started on'''

'''module load java/1.8.0_25'''

'''module load openmpi/2.1.1'''

'''module load glib/2.40.0'''

'''module load gcc/4.8.0'''

'''module load anaconda3/2019.03'''

'''conda activate emade2'''

'''echo "STARTING EMADE"'''

'''python src/GPFramework/launchEMADE.py templates/INPUT_XML.xml'''

'''#python src/GPFramework/seeding_from_file.py templates/input_summaries.xml summary_seed'''

'''#uncomment above line and comment the first python line if you want to seed your db'''
* If there are other mysql servers running you may need to specify a port (multiple mysql servers can't run on the same port):
** Add `port=3306` (or some other port number) to your .my.cnf file in the line before mysqld_safe
* Run `qsub pbsmysql.pbs`
** Once it is running, use qstat to find the number id off your job and qstat -n to find the node it is running on, e.g. rich133-c32-10-r
*** If you modified your port, make this rich133-c32-10-r:PORTNUMBER
** Change the template file you’re using for emade so the host is that address
** Create the databases and users you need by ssh’ing into that node, `ssh rich133-c32-10-r` and running mysql
*** Note: you made need to run `mysql -u root` or something along those lines to make changes to databases, as you’ll need root privileges
*** Note 2: For your users make sure you make the host “%”, meaning a wildcard that will allow you to connect using that user from other locations
*** Note 3: If you want to check if your setup is correct: type in select user, host, password from mysql.user;
**** This will show all users and hosts and their respective passwords. You need to make sure that you have a user 'root' with host '%'
**** E.g. “user”@“%”
* You should be all set up!
* Run `qsub runEMADE.pbs` and start looking for results!
